The NAO index is obtained by projecting the NAO loading pattern to the daily anomaly 500 millibar height field over 0-90¡N. The NAO loading pattern has been chosen as the first mode of a Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis using monthly mean 500 millibar height anomaly data from 1950 to 2000 over 0-90¡N latitude.
